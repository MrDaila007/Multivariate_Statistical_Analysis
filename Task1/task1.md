1. Use any statistical software (preferably, R) to complete the task.

2. Prepare the code for making possible generation of several sub-samples from the 3-dimensional Normal (Gaussian) probability distribution with parameters being set in the code. The sub-sample volumes should be set in the code.

3. Visualize (using 3D-scatter diagrams) the subsamples in one plot using different colours for different subsamples. Analyze how the structure of the Covariance matrix influence on the form of the resulting scatter clouds.

4. Prepare a PDF of your results and submit here.
